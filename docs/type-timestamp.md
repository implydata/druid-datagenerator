## Synthetic timestamps

When an [emitter dimension](./generator-emitters.md#dimensions) type is `timestamp`, a timestamp is generated in ISO format.

| Field | Description | Possible values | Required? | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | The data type for the dimension. | `timestamp` | Yes ||
| `name` | The unique name for the dimension. | String | Yes ||
| `cardinality` | Indicates the number of unique values for this dimension. Use zero for unconstrained cardinality. | Integer | Yes ||
| `cardinality_distribution` | Skews the cardinality selection of the generated values. | A [distribution](./distributions.md) object. | Yes, if `cardinality` not 0.||
| `percent_missing` | The stochastic frequency for omitting this dimension from records (inclusive). | Integer between 0 and 100. | No. | 0 |
| `percent_nulls` | The stochastic frequency (inclusive) for generating null values. | Integer between 0 and 100. | No. | 0 |
| `distribution` | Describes the distribution of timestamp values the driver generates, with the dates given in ISO format. | A [distribution](./distributions.md) object. | Yes ||

In this example, there are two states: `state_1` and `state_2`. There is a 20% probability that the data generator will switch to `state_2` after `state_1`.

The emitter for `state_1` is `example_event_1`. This emits a simple [`string`](#string) as `emitter_number`, and `timestamp` in the range between 1st January 2020 at 3pm and 1st January 2020 at 8pm. `percent_nulls` adds a 25% chance that the value is null.

The emitter for `state_2` is `example_event_2` which also emits a simple string containing the emitter number. The `timestamp` for these events lie between 1st and 2nd of January 1920.

This is an example of the output:
