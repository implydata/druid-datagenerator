## Distributions

Distributions set how the data being created is distributed.

Distributions are used for [`interarrival`](./config-interarrival) and emitter dimension [`values`](./emitters).

| Field | Description | Possible values | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | The type of distribution to use. | [`constant`](#constant) [`uniform`](#uniform) [`exponential`](#exponential) [`normal`](#normal) | Yes |
| options | Depending on the `type`, fields that set the behavior of the distribution. | | Yes |

### Distribution types

The data generator supports a number of distribution types.

Each distribution type has options that prescribe how the data generator will output the data.

#### `constant`

The constant distribution generates the same single value.

```
{
  "type": "constant",
  "value": <value>
}
```

Where _value_ is the value generated by this distribution.

#### `uniform`

Uniform distribution generates values uniformly between _min_ and _max_ (inclusive).

```
{
  "type": "uniform",
  "min": <value>,
  "max": <value>
}
```

Where:
- _min_ is the minimum value sampled
- _max_ is the maximum value sampled

#### `exponential`

Exponenital distributions generate values following an exponential distribution around the mean.

```
{
  "type": "exponential",
  "mean": <value>
}
```

Where _mean_ is the resulting average value of the distribution.

####Â `normal`

Normal distributions generate values with a normal (i.e., bell-shaped) distribution.

```
{
  "type": "normal",
  "mean": <value>,
  "stddev": <value>
}

```

Where:
- _mean_ is the average value
- _stddev_ is the stadard deviation of the distribution

Note that negative values generated by the normal distribution may be forced to zero when necessary (e.g., interarrival times).
