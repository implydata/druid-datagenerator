## Synthetic counters

When an [emitter dimension](./genspec-emitters.md#dimensions) type is `counter`, the value is increment each time they are output.

Counters are not incremented when missing or null.

| Field | Description | Possible values | Required? | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | The data type for the dimension. | `float` | Yes ||
| `name` | The unique name for the dimension. | String | Yes ||
| `percent_missing` | The stochastic frequency for omitting this dimension from records (inclusive). | Integer between 0 and 100. | No. | 0 |
| `percent_nulls` | The stochastic frequency (inclusive) for generating null values. | Integer between 0 and 100. | No. | 0 |
| `start` | The starting value for the counter. | Integer | No. | 0 |
| `increment` | The increment for the counter. | Integer | No. | 1 |

In this example, there are two worker states, `state_1` and `state_2`. There's a 50% probability that, in each state, the other state will be selected next.

Each state has its own emitter, `state_1` uses `example_event_1`, `state_2` uses `example_event_2`.

The first emitter, `example_event_1`, contains four counter dimensions:

* `default_counter1` uses all defaults, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1.
* `start_counter1` begins at 100, and uses the default increment of 1.
* `increment_counter1` uses the default start of 0, but has a specific increment of 10000.
* `both_counter1` uses both a specific start and increment, 250 and 50 respectively.

The second emitter, `example_event_2`, mirrors the same configuration, using different dimension names and different start and increment values.

        { "type": "counter", "name": "both_counter2", "start": 750, "increment": 50 }
      ]
    }
  ],

  "interarrival": { "type": "constant", "value": 1 }
}
```

This is an example of the output using one worker.
