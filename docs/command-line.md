## Generate data from the command line

Run the `DruidDataDriver.py` script from the command line to create synthetic data in JSON format.

```
python generator/DruidDataDriver.py
		-f <generator specification file
		-m <generator workers limit>
		-o <target specification file>
		-s <start timestamp>
		-n <record limit>
		-t <duration limit>
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`-f`](#generator-specification) | The name of the file in the `config_file` folder containing the [generator specification](#generator-specification).|
| [`-m`](#generator-specification) | The maximum number of workers to create. Defaults to 100. |
| [`-o`](#target-specification) | The name of the file that contains the [target definition](#target.md). |
| [`-s`](#simulated-clock) | Use a simulated clock, starting at the specified ISO time, rather than using the system clock. |
| [`-n`](#generation-limit) | The number of records to generate. Must not be used in combinaton with `-t`. |
| [`-t`](#generation-limit) | The length of time to create records for. Must not be used in combination with `-n`. |

### Prerequities

The data generator requires Python 3.

```
apt-get install python3
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip
```

The data generator has dependencies on a number of modules. Run the following commands to prepare your Python environment.

```
pip install confluent-kafka
pip install python-dateutil
pip install kafka-python
pip install numpy
pip install sortedcontainers
```

### Generator specification

The [generator specification](genspec.md) is a JSON document that sets how the data generator will execute. When the `-f` option is used, the generation specification will be read from a file in `./config_files`, otherwise the generator specification will be read from `stdin`.

The following sections of the JSON document concern what each data generator worker will do.

* A list of [`states`](./genspec-states.md) that a worker can transition through.
* A list of [`emitters`](./genspec-emitters.md), listing the dimensions that will be output by a worker and what data they will contain.
* A [`target`]('./tarspec.md) definition, stating where records should be written. This is optional, and can be supplied as a file using the `-o` argument.

Finally, the specification sets the `interarrival` time, controlling how often a new worker is spawned. The default maximum number of workers is 100, unless the `-m` argument is used.

### Target specification

Set the output of the data generator by setting the `target` object.

Use the _-o_ option to designate a target definition file name. The [target](./target.md) defines where the generated messages are sent.

### Generation limit

Use either `-n` or `-t` to limit how long generation executes for. If neither option is present, the script will run indefinitely.

#### Limit generation to a length of time

Time durations may be specified in terms of seconds, minutes or hours.

For example, specify 30 seconds as follows:

```
python generator/DruidDataDriver.py -c generator_spec.json -o target_spec.json -t 30S
```

Specify 10 minutes as follows:

```
python generator/DruidDataDriver.py -c generator_spec.json -o target_spec.json -t 10M
```

Or, specify 1 hour as follows:

```
python generator/DruidDataDriver.py -c generator_spec.json -o target_spec.json -t 1H
```

#### Limit generation to a number of records

Use `-n` to limit generation to a number of records.

```
python generator/DruidDataDriver.py -c generator_spec.json -o target_spec.json -n 1000
```

### Simulated clock

Specify a start time in ISO format to instruct the driver to use simulated time instead of the system clock time (the default).

In the following example, the constraint is the number of records.

```
python3 generator/DruidDataDriver.py -f example.json -o stdout.json -n 20 -s "2001-12-20T13:13"
```

* `example.json` generator specification from the `config_file` directory is used.
* The `target` in `stdout.json` determines where the JSON records will be output.
* `-n` requires that only 20 rows are output.
* The synthetic `time` clock will start on 20th December 2001 at 13:13pm.

This results in:

```
{"time":"2001-12-20T13:13:12.132","server":"127.0.0.5","client":"63.211.68.115","endpoint":"GET /api/users/73/contributions","response_time_ms":326}
{"time":"2001-12-20T13:13:17.464","server":"127.0.0.3","client":"79.58.216.203","endpoint":"GET /api/search?q=quantum-mechanics","response_time_ms":262}
{"time":"2001-12-20T13:13:20.776","server":"127.0.0.4","client":"96.54.85.35","endpoint":"GET /api/categories","response_time_ms":75}
{"time":"2001-12-20T13:13:28.023","server":"127.0.0.4","client":"96.54.85.35","endpoint":"GET /api/articles/56/contributors","response_time_ms":41}
{"time":"2001-12-20T13:13:28.077","server":"127.0.0.5","client":"18.202.244.47","endpoint":"POST /api/feedback","response_time_ms":179194}
```

In the next example, the constraint is duration. This will cause the generator to create as many JSON records as would fit into a given duration (see `-t` below).

```
python3 generator/DruidDataDriver.py -f example.json -o stdout.json -t 1h -s "2027-03-12"
```

* The `-s` flag sets a synthetic clock start of 12th March 2027.
* Since `-t` is set to `1h`, the generator creates an hour's worth of data.

The result is a list of events spanning an hour from the time given in `-s`. This is therefore recommended when generating large volumes of data.
